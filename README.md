Note: we have neither set up virtual environment. In the next project we'll do it. We'll also set up a testing folder.

### Step 1. 
Install these django plugins from VSCode marketplace: django-intellisense, django Template and django Snippets. They will make your life easier.

### Step 2. 
Create the folder in terminal:
```
mkdir myecom
```
### Step 3. 
Get inside the folder 
```
cd myecom
```
and run the following command:
```
django-admin startproject
```
### Step 4.
Create a github repository to link the local one. Use thse commands step by step (run one by one):
```
git init
gh repo create
git add .
git commit -m 'your comment'
git push origin master
```
After the first push, change the branch with the following command:
```
git checkout -b your_branchname
```
